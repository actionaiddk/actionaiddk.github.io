#### ⚠️ **IMPORTANT** ⚠️ ####
Not finding any indications of compromise does **NOT** mean your device is not infected. It just means that the public indicators of compromise was not matched with data extracted from your phone. The indicators are derived from forensic work and they are publicly available. This means the the spyware authors have access to them as well, and can rule them out of future spyware and infections.
