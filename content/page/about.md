## About Tails-MVT

[**Tails-MVT**](https://github.com/ztychr/tails) is a customised version of [Tails](https://tails.net/) that has the [Mobile Verification Toolkit](https://github.com/mvt-project/mvt) preinstalled and working out of the box. Tails-MVT is meant for non-advanced users. If you have a technical background, you may want to setup [MVT](https://github.com/mvt-project/mvt) yourself and follow the official [MVT Documentation](https://docs.mvt.re/en/latest/).
